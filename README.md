What started as a a long term assignment in my .Net class, turned into a project.
The purpose of the project is for me to have a development space to mess around with a variety of technologies. As well as creating a safe space for me to fail, try my best to learn and implement a solution.
The main functionality of the program is to generate random gift assignments in a group of users. 

This build is reserved for new features and more like a playground type build. 


## Features

- Clean and simple UI.
- User's and Group's page for simple add and removals.
- MVC pattern for speedy features development. 
- Automated tests.


## Demo

Coming soon...
