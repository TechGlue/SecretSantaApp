# Secret Santa üéÖüèΩ


What started as a a long term assignment in my .Net class, turned into a project.
The purpose of the project is for me to have a development space to mess around with a variety of technologies. As well as creating a safe space for me to fail, try my best to learn and implement a solution.
The main functionality of the program is to generate random gift assignments in a group of users. 

**Very much a work in progress**. Build is currently not fully working and other features will be implemented at a later date. 
In the mean time check out my original fork to see the growth of the assignment.


## Features

- Clean and simple UI.
- User's and Group's page for simple add and removals.
- MVC pattern for speedy features development. 
- Automated tests.


## Demo

Coming soon...
